# Current research state

Last verified: 2026-09-18.

## Research question

The broad question is whether narratives created from social experience can
carry information that changes cooperation, including when that information
reaches agents outside the original pair. The current evidence is strongest
for model- and condition-dependent behavioral effects, with promising older
content-transplant evidence. Reliable emergence and persistence of population
culture remains unresolved. See the [design reference](../experiment_design_reference.md)
and [data audit](../research/mixed_future_data_audit.md).

## Current operational state

- The **frontier-model rerun completed 90/90 validated finals** on 2026-09-18:
  the September no-defector matrix on Claude Opus 5 (adaptive thinking, effort
  high), Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview (thinking high) and GPT-5.6 Sol (effort high),
  five replicates per cell, $142.55. Opus 5 sits 13–19 points above Sonnet 4.5
  in five of six cells (6 points in 8-agent myth→game, where Sonnet was already at 69) and shows game < game→myth < myth→game at both sizes (Sonnet showed it in dyads only); Gemini 3.1
  Pro is ceiling-locked like 3.7 Flash; Sol replaces Nano's game-only zero-lock
  with a partial collapse in 2 of 10 game-only runs that the myth task removes.
  Thinking regime changed with the model (Claude 4.7+ rejects the fixed budget).
  See [D011](decisions/011-frontier-model-rerun.md) and
  [the results README](../figures/frontier_rerun_20260918/README.md).
- The **mixed-model dyad stage completed 54/54 validated finals** on
  2026-09-17/18 (Sonnet/GPT, Sonnet/Gemini and Gemini/GPT; game, game→myth,
  myth→game; six replicates with the first sender alternating by family).
  Every family's sending tracks its partner: Sonnet follows Gemini up and GPT
  down, GPT's game-only zero-lock persists against both partners, and Gemini
  stops sending after two unreciprocated rounds against GPT. A myth task breaks
  the lock in every composition. See
  [the results README](../figures/mixed_model_dyads_20260917/README.md) and
  [D010](decisions/010-mixed-model-population-sizes.md).
- The exact two-agent counterpart to the slide-678 rerun completed 35/35
  validated finals with the same seven donor contexts and pinned Sonnet host
  profile. The qualitative ladder largely persists in one fixed dyad: late
  Sonnet is strongest, filler is near baseline, and low-cooperation myths are
  below baseline. See [D008](decisions/008-myth-transplant-isolation.md).
- The seven-cell slide-678 transplant rerun completed 35/35 validated finals
  using existing donor texts, historical myth-only/negative-$5 apparatus and
  pinned September Sonnet settings. The qualitative seed ladder reappeared;
  late Sonnet reached the ceiling while filler and late GPT stayed near baseline.
  Linguistic analysis still precedes later content deletion; see [D008](decisions/008-myth-transplant-isolation.md).
- The **180 no-defector extension runs completed** after explicit user approval
  and design reconciliation. They add no-noise and uninformed negative-only noise
  at the September profiles; retain the 90 existing informed-noise controls.
  See [D005](decisions/005-hold-180-runs.md) for the superseded hold and approval.
- All 270 full-state sources were hash-checked and condition-validated for
  [the resource and delta figures](../figures/figure2_noise_comparison_20260916/README.md).
  Two Claude runs were resampled after role-key errors; GPT unfinished runs
  were rerun after credits were replenished. Preserve those caveats.
- The targeted informed `U(-2, 0)` dyad bridge completed 20/20 clean finals:
  five paired game-only/myth-first replicates for Claude and Gemini. See the
  [range-2 bridge report](../figures/noise_strength_bridge_20260916/README.md).
- No-defector comparisons are fixed dyads versus rotating populations with
  partner history, not a pure manipulation of agent count.

## Current design understanding

- Ordinary checked eight-agent runs hide display names, retain own game/myth
  exchanges through memory-primary chat context, provide the current
  co-player's three-game history separately, and transmit the previous
  round partner's myth locally. These statements are scoped to the checked
  conditions, not every historical run. See [D001](decisions/001-history-and-memory.md)
  and [D002](decisions/002-anonymity-and-local-transmission.md).
- Negative-only informed communication noise is recorded in the later
  comparison design. Earlier replacement, bidirectional, environmental, and
  communication-noise runs remain distinct conditions. See
  [D003](decisions/003-noise-semantics.md).
- Later runs use explicit model-specific request profiles. These profiles do
  not reveal missing historical API settings or make provider reasoning labels
  equivalent. See [D004](decisions/004-model-request-profiles.md).
- The mixed-model dyad stage (Sonnet/GPT, Sonnet/Gemini, Gemini/GPT; 54
  runs) is complete. The eight-agent stage is a contagion ladder launched
  2026-09-18 (90 runs, running): 1/2/4 Gemini among GPT and 1/2/4 GPT among
  Sonnet under the unchanged September population protocol, replacing the
  4+4 cross-family-only plan. Task orders are `game`, `game_myth` and
  `myth_game`; no shared-prose arm is selected. See
  [D010](decisions/010-mixed-model-population-sizes.md).

## Result boundaries

- The pinned-profile slide-678 rerun is descriptive at n=5 donor/run replicates
  per cell. It shows strong context-dependent behavioral differences under the
  historical transplant apparatus, but does not isolate narrative form from
  actionable content or separately estimate donor and run variation.
- The matched dyad rerun is also descriptive at n=5. It shows content-dependent
  differences under the current repeated-seed/no-history apparatus, so the old
  Phase-1 content null is not a general dyad result. It does not isolate which
  historical protocol difference accounts for the reversal.
- The audited September no-defector result is model-dependent: myth-first
  increases ordinary-agent resources for Claude and GPT in the checked setup;
  Gemini is already at the ceiling. With forced defection, differences shrink
  or become uncertain. See the [independently reproduced table](../research/mixed_future_data_audit.md#latest-figures-independently-reproduced).
- In the current dyad protocol, Claude's observed difference of medians was
  +20.0 at range 2 versus +3.5 at range 1; all five range-2 paired effects were
  positive. The pattern is consistent with a noise-strength explanation, but
  the five-replicate direct range contrast is too uncertain to establish one.
  Gemini stayed ceiling-locked at 75 throughout.
- Historical myth-transplant results show that different injected texts can
  produce different behavior under an older apparatus. They do not yet prove
  emergent population culture in the current pipeline.
- Do not resurrect interpretations listed in
  [Findings that must not be resurrected](../research/mixed_future_data_audit.md#findings-that-must-not-be-resurrected),
  including the pre-August-12 dyad collapse, the raw 88% meme-inheritance
  claim, or a population-wide cultural collapse caused by defectors.
  The dyad boundary is tracked in [D006](decisions/006-pre-august-dyad-results-invalid.md).
- Descriptive/normative myth prompts and game-side directives are distinct
  interventions ([D007](decisions/007-prompt-regimes.md)); transplant controls
  are a separate causal design ([D008](decisions/008-myth-transplant-isolation.md));
  permanent and random forced defection are distinct stress treatments
  ([D009](decisions/009-defector-treatments.md)).

## Open questions

- Which myth information causes behavioral change, beyond extra text,
  reflection, or explicit strategic advice?
- Does useful information survive transmission to newcomers who never met the
  source agents?
- Which task-order effects survive a comparison where decision-time inputs are
  genuinely different?
