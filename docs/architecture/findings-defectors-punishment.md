# Findings: mechanical defectors and the deduction institution

The defector/punishment thread (2026-08-12 → 2026-08-23): hidden mechanical
defectors (`defector_action_policy: forced_zero` — scripted zero sends/returns,
no LLM game calls, myths still LLM-written, treatment label hidden) crossed
with an optional sender-side costly deduction stage (2 points, 1:3
cost-to-target, payoff floor zero).

## Defectors: direct losses, no confirmed cascade

25% hidden defectors impose large mechanical balance losses (−$19 to −$22 per
ordinary agent) but **no confirmed population-wide behavioral or cultural
collapse**: at n=10/cell in both GPT-5 Nano and Gemini Flash-Lite, ordinary
sending (−.013, p=.258) and ordinary-myth cooperation language (p=.300) do not
move. _(from researchlog 2026-08-21)_

**Gemini shows a replicated behavior→culture imprint:** defector *authors*
(forced to defect, writing myths freely) diverge culturally in rounds 2–10 —
−.57 cooperation terms/100 words, +.06 threat terms — absent in round 1 and
absent in GPT. Forced behavior becomes culturally visible in Gemini only.
_(from researchlog 2026-08-21)_

**Circulation transmits tone, not behavior.** Swapping defector-authored myths
for ordinary ones at cultural exposures changes presented cooperation language
but not game behavior; the one-step threat-transmission signal from the screen
(23-vs-5 threat matches) failed independent replication (26 vs 22, p=.624) —
a false positive or seed-contingent pattern. _(from researchlog 2026-08-21)_

## Punishment is model-dependent: GPT spends, Gemini sanctions

- **GPT-5 Nano fails the mechanism.** Deductions are near-universal (90.9% of
  opportunities) and untargeted (defector-minus-ordinary contrast ≈0);
  availability yields no reliable cooperative benefit in a 2×2 with defectors.
  Controlled calibration rejects both wordings: current wording deducts in
  100% of high-return cases; cost-salient wording halves spending but removes
  return sensitivity entirely. GPT treats deduction as a salient action, not a
  calibrated sanction — do not tune prose toward a desired result.
  _(from researchlog 2026-08-21)_
- **Gemini Flash-Lite passes.** Calibration: both points at $0 returns, zero
  at any positive return (cross-model return-slope interaction −1.244,
  p=.0057). Live-noise threshold sits between $.25 and $.50 visible return, so
  a true-zero defector is punished ~69% of the time under ±$1 noise. In
  populations, targeting is decisive and replicated: ~81–86% of
  hidden-defector opportunities punished vs ~2–3% of ordinary receivers, with
  zero deductions after any visibly ≥half return. This is selective response
  to observed defection, not role recognition. _(from researchlog 2026-08-21,
  2026-08-22)_
- **Gemini 3.7 Flash generalizes the sanction, more graded**: full deduction
  at 0–10% returns, partial at 25%, zero at ≥50%; live targeting perfect
  (25/25 defectors, 0/65 ordinary). _(from researchlog 2026-08-23)_

## Punishment's downstream effect: crowding, defector-dependent, version-specific

In Gemini Flash-Lite, making deductions *available* *lowers* ordinary return
ratios — confirmed twice: matched arms −.0491 (Holm p=.0099) and the frozen
new-seed 2×2 −.0455 in defector populations (Holm p=.0121), with the
availability×defector interaction −.0373 (Holm p=.0373) and a near-zero
no-defector simple effect. The effect is absent in round 1 and grows to −.137
by round 10; returns shift toward exactly-half and away from generosity —
punishment anchors the minimally fair rule (motivational crowding-out).
Ordinary myths under the institution gain punishment/threat/betrayal language,
more so with defectors present. _(from researchlog 2026-08-22, 2026-08-23)_

**Not in Gemini 3.7:** the crowding effect does not reproduce (+.0026,
CI [−.0016,+.0069]) — 3.7's rigid "return exactly half of receipt" rule
(280/370 decisions exact to the cent) leaves no motivational room. Selective
punishment generalizes across Gemini versions; crowding does not. Frozen
decision: do not scale the 3.7 population design. _(from researchlog 2026-08-23)_

## Cross-model defector set (Claude / GPT-5 Nano / Gemini 3.7): provisional

The negative-only cross-model defector series (2026-08-25; 2 and 8 agents ×
game / game→myth / myth→game × 0 / 25 / 50% defectors, n=5) showed Gemini 3.7
Flash ceiling-locking without forced defection, GPT-5 Nano beating Claude
Sonnet 4.5 on collective returns in some conditions, and Claude degrading
notably once defectors are added. _(from researchlog 2026-09-01)_

**These cross-model orderings are unconfirmed.** The three models ran on three
direct vendor APIs with unmatched settings: Claude with thinking off at T=0.8
and a 4096 cap, GPT-5 Nano at reasoning effort *minimal* (the code default,
zero reasoning tokens on every call) with temperature fixed at 1.0, Gemini 3.7
with medium thinking. Claude also carries ~1,000+ characters of its own
strategy prose in memory each round while the other two carry bare JSON.
Message roles are equivalent, and no parse defaults, truncation or model
aliasing occurred, so the data are clean but the conditions are not matched.
Rerun the GPT-5 Nano cells at matched effort and control the prose confound
before citing a ranking. _(from researchlog 2026-09-04)_

## Standing design gates

- Baseline Gemini cells (both versions) are **ceiling-limited** — 3.7 sent the
  full $5 in all 360 sender decisions, making task-order/identity contrasts
  uninformative there. Punishment calibrations and defector stress tests are
  the variance-bearing designs for Gemini. _(from researchlog 2026-08-21, 2026-08-23)_
- Model eligibility for population pilots runs through the controlled
  calibration gate (selectivity: low-minus-high separation, zero high-return
  punishment, monotonicity) before any paid population cells.
