Trust Game with Noise and Asymmetric Naming Support

This module extends the standard trust game with:
1. Amount noise: Distort communicated amounts vs actual amounts
2. Asymmetric naming: The OTHER player's role is presented with a mythological name

Noise types:
- uniform: Add random noise from uniform distribution
- probabilistic: With probability p, replace amount with random/zero/max value
- decay: Information becomes less accurate over time (future extension)

Asymmetric naming:
- YOUR role stays generic ("You are the INVESTOR")
- The OTHER player's role can be mythological ("Prometheus sent you $3...")
