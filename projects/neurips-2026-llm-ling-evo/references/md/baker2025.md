### Abstract

Mitigating reward hacking—where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or misspecifications in their learning objectives—remains a key challenge in constructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model’s chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent’s training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn *obfuscated reward hacking*, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a *monitorability tax* by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.

## 1 Introduction

Exploiting flaws or misspecifications in learning objectives, known as reward hacking in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, remains a critical failure mode in modern AI systems [1–3] and has led to agents exhibiting misaligned behaviors across many domains such as language modeling [4–6], control tasks [7–10], and recommendation systems [11–14]. The true objective function we wish to optimize is often hard to write down precisely, and so the challenge in creating capable and aligned systems largely lies in designing robust proxies that do not deviate in ways that a model may learn to exploit [3, 15]. This problem is not unique to machine learning systems but has also plagued human institutions [16–19]. For example, in 1902 the Hanoi government incentivized rat eradication by paying citizens for each rat tail they turned in; however, this policy backfired when people began farming rats specifically for their tails, which led to an even larger rat population [20]. Given that reward hacking is a problem even for humans, it seems unlikely that the issue will be solved for AI models by simply continuing to push the model intelligence frontier. In fact, enhancing an agent’s capabilities may exacerbate the problem by better equipping it to discover and execute more complex and hard-to-monitor exploits [21, 22]. We have found this to be anecdotally true: as we have continued to scale RL training, agents have discovered more complex and hard-to-detect hacks. Thus far, the only general strategy for mitigating reward hacking is to manually monitor agents for unintended behavior, which is unlikely to scale as their outputs and actions grow more complex—possibly even superhuman—and become more widely used.

The emerging generation of large language models (LLMs) [23] that are trained with reinforcement learning to reason in chain-of-thought (CoT) [24–26] offers a promising new avenue for monitoring. Where LLMs are normally trained to give an answer directly after a prompt, CoT reasoning models first produce their reasoning and then give their answer. In particular, these reasoning models are trained by an RL procedure that searches for chains-of-thought that maximize the probability of the model giving a high reward answer. Because LLMs are pretrained on human text, the CoTs that are most instrumentally useful to generating a correct answer are likely to also be articulated in human language and relevant to the task at hand. If indeed naturally understandable reasoning traces are the most instrumentally useful, they will be reinforced through the RL training process. As a result, it is plausible that CoTs will reveal critical insights into the agent’s decision-making in language naturally understandable by both humans and LLMs, and we empirically find this to often be the case. For example, consider a scenario where an agent is tasked with implementing a feature change in order to make unit tests pass in a code repository, and it has two actions available to it—hack: make unit tests pass trivially, or genuine fix: implement the feature with a correct and general solution. If it first articulates in its CoT, "This seems hard, let me try to skip some of the unit tests," then it is likely that hack is a more natural continuation and more probable under the LLM prior, i.e. $p_{LLM}(hack|CoT) > p_{LLM}(genuine fix|CoT)$.

![Figure 1: Chain-of-thought from a frontier reasoning model discovered to be reward hacking in the wild.](figure1_placeholder)  
*Figure 1: Chain-of-thought from a frontier reasoning model discovered to be reward hacking in the wild. The agent is tasked with fixing a small code repository by alternating between CoT messages, viewing files, and editing files. Because full agent solutions (trajectories) can be long, we show summarizations of the trajectory (a mix of CoT, tool calls, and code patches) in red, the raw CoT directly quoted in green, and code patch tool calls in blue. We mask variable names for IP considerations, and we bold certain phrases in CoT excerpts for emphasis. The agent notes that the tests only check a certain function, and that it would presumably be "Hard" to implement a genuine solution. The agent then notes it could "fudge" and circumvent the tests by making **verify** always return **true**. This is a real example that was detected by our GPT-4o hack detector during a frontier RL run, and we show more examples in Appendix A.*

Indeed, when examining a frontier reasoning model’s chain-of-thought, we have found it is common to find coherent reasoning that explicitly outlines intent and strategies to subvert the task at hand (see Figure 1). While questions remain regarding whether chains-of-thought are fully faithful [27, 28], i.e. that they fully capture and do not omit significant portions of the model’s underlying reasoning, it seems clear that they are not devoid of signal relevant for monitoring.

During a recent frontier reasoning model training run, we tested just how useful this signal in agent CoTs can be. We found that a simple prompted LLM (we used GPT-4o [29]) is very effective at monitoring for reward hacking behavior within agentic coding environments, and we also discovered that our CoT monitor performs much better than a monitor with access to only the agent’s actions and outputs (See Section 2). We underscore that at the time of this experiment, the agent being monitored was OpenAI’s most advanced model, performing better at hard reasoning tasks than even its predecessors, OpenAI o1 [24] and o3-mini [30]. We conducted our monitoring in real time as the frontier agent trained, which allowed us to surface hacks and bugs in the environment that could be patched during training.

We further find that a relatively weak reasoning and programming model can monitor a model far more capable than itself: namely that GPT-4o can effectively monitor a frontier reasoning model. We even find that GPT-4o-mini, an even weaker programmer, is able to detect a nontrivial amount of reward hacking. While only an initial experiment, we believe this result provides promising evidence that CoT monitoring may provide a new avenue for scalable oversight [2, 31], where trusted weaker models and humans help to oversee superior, even superhuman, models.

Because chain-of-thought monitors can perform so well at detecting undesired actions, it is natural to ask whether they can be used directly as a reward signal during training. Will preventing "bad thoughts" also reduce the amount of downstream bad behavior? While this theory seems plausible, such an objective could cause agents to learn to hide their intent within the CoT while continuing to exhibit misaligned behavior, a phenomenon we will call *obfuscated reward hacking*. We investigate the effect of incorporating a CoT monitor into the reward function as a non-frontier reasoning model trains in a series of agentic coding environments, in which agents must update a repository to satisfy a suite of unit tests. We further compare using monitors during training as a reward signal to using them at deployment via rejection sampling, and we find mixed results. At relatively low levels of RL optimization, incorporating the CoT monitor into the reward signal yields a strict improvement, producing a more capable agent while not increasing the amount of reward hacking relative to the baseline. However, further into training the agent begins to exhibit obfuscated reward hacking and learns to fool the monitor. Upon inspection, it is clear that the agent learns to obfuscate its intent within the CoT by emitting seemingly benign chains-of-thought while continuing on to perform reward hacks that it did not explicitly reason about.

While we primarily study the effect of using the CoT monitor as an explicit reward signal, patching our environment based on trajectories flagged by the CoT monitor could still exert a very slight evolutionary pressure on the CoT. By only patching the bugs we can find with CoT monitoring, it is unclear if we are inadvertently pushing the model towards reward hacks our monitor cannot find instead of the aligned behavior distribution we would like it to learn. Although we have not yet found empirical evidence of this effect, understanding how much optimization pressure can be applied before it leads to obfuscated chains-of-thought is a critical area for future research.

The natural monitorability of chain-of-thought models is quite remarkable, and we believe it has the potential to drive significant advances in model safety. However, there are many incentives to apply direct optimization pressure to the CoT thereby diminishing the signal relevant for monitoring, such as:

*   **Showing CoTs to users.** Apart from improving reasoning performance, chains-of-thought can be informative and give insight into how the model arrived at its answer. However, to present the reasoning to users, CoTs need to comply with usage policies [26]. For example, if a user asks the model to help them produce a dangerous chemical, a reasoning model may reveal information about the material it shouldn’t before deciding to refuse the request. However, if the CoT is directly trained to comply in this way, harmful intentions of the agent may become obfuscated.
*   **Alignment.** As we explore in this paper, training against chain-of-thought monitors may produce more capable and seemingly more aligned models; however, the precipice between genuine improvement and promoting obfuscation may be hard to identify in practice.
*   **Cost.** Tokens are expensive, and shortening the CoT length or utilizing alternative architectures that use more flops per token may make model inference cheaper and lower latency. However, the shorter the CoT, the less tokens there are to provide signal for monitoring [32]. We have not yet discovered this to be an issue, but we are actively tracking it.

For some of these incentives, alternative remedies may exist that do not require pressuring agent CoTs: for example, instead of directly showing users the chains-of-thought, they could be shown summaries produced by an auxiliary model, allowing the agent’s CoT to remain unrestricted. However, capability improvements and cost reductions may not be substituted so easily, and therefore frontier model developers may be required to pay some cost, i.e. a *monitorability tax* [33], such as deploying slightly less performant models or suffering more expensive inference, in order to maintain the monitorability of our agents. We hope that our work illuminates the risks of using chain-of-thought pressures and why such a tax may be worth paying. In summary our contributions are:

1.  We show that frontier reasoning models often perform complex reward hacks in real-world coding environments.
2.  We provide evidence that chain-of-thought monitoring can be effective in detecting the misaligned behavior of frontier reasoning models, and we show it can be far more accurate than action-only monitoring.
3.  We show that chain-of-thought monitorability is very fragile. Applying direct optimization pressure to the CoT can quickly lead to obfuscated reward hacking—where agents hide their intent while continuing to misbehave.

## 2 Monitoring Frontier Reasoning Models for Reward Hacking

CoT monitoring is already useful today, not a speculative tool for the future. We show that frontier reasoning agents can be effectively monitored by other LLMs. We note that at the time of these experiments, the agent we monitored was OpenAI’s most advanced model, surpassing even OpenAI o3-mini in hard reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we conducted our monitoring experiments as the agent trained, meaning this was not a post-hoc experiment to validate whether we could catch hacks we knew to exist, but rather a critical method that helped us detect hacks realtime.

We implemented a GPT-4o prompted monitor to detect reward hacking in agentic coding environments. In these environments the agent is tasked with implementing new functionality such that all unit tests pass. Our monitors are simply prompted to look for evidence of hacking or skipping unit tests without implementing correct functionality; see Appendix C for the full monitor prompt.

### 2.1 Catching Systemic Reward Hacking

While training the frontier reasoning model, we found two particularly effective coding hacks: `exit(0)`, where the agent exploited a bug that allowed it to exit from the environment early without running all unit tests, and `raise SkipTest`, in which the agent raised an exception from functions outside the testing framework in order to skip unit test evaluation. Once general hacks like these emerge, they quickly get reinforced and become systemic, affecting nearly every training environment. Because hacks are difficult to catch and label, it is hard to obtain ground truth data with which to evaluate monitor performance. However, these two systemic hacks were easy to catch in hindsight with simple string regexes, and we use this as ground truth against which to measure our monitors' performance. In Figure 2 and Table 1 we compare the performance of two monitors, each of which is the same prompted model but differ in what they each observe of the agent:

1.  **CoT Monitor:** Observes the entire agent trajectory including CoT, tool calls, and final outputs
2.  **Action Monitor:** Observes only the tool calls and final outputs

![Figure 2: Catching Systemic Hacks in Frontier Models](figure2_placeholder)  
*Figure 2: Monitoring Frontier Reasoning Models for Reward Hacking. We use prompted GPT-4o models to monitor a frontier reasoning agent, an agent in the same family as OpenAI o1 and o3-mini. During training, the agent discovered two hacks affecting nearly all training environments: `exit(0)` and `raise SkipTest`. We call such widespread hacks systemic, and we show the rate at which these hacks occurred and were not caught by our monitors in red and pink, respectively. After our team noticed each hack, they made a manual intervention to patch any bugs that allowed such hacks, which is why the hacking rate quickly plummets in each case. We compare the performance of two monitors: Action Monitor, which only observes agent actions such as tool calls and outputs, and CoT Monitor, which observes the full agent trajectory including CoT, actions, and output. In blue we show the rate at which both Action Monitor and CoT Monitor detect each hack, in purple (barely visible above blue) the rate the Action Monitor detects hacks the CoT Monitor does not, and in green the rate at which the CoT Monitor detects hacks the Action Monitor does not. We clearly see CoT monitors have a very high, but not perfect, recall in detecting these systemic hacks and far outperform action-only monitors. Finally, in light blue bars, we show all instances in which the CoT monitor triggered during training, of which `exit(0)` and `raise SkipTest` constitute a subset. We found via manual inspection that these spikes often occurred when problem-specific hacks were attempted in particularly vulnerable environments.*

| Monitor | Recall (`exit(0)`) | Recall (`raise SkipTest`) | Recall (Joint) | ~ Precision (Joint) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Action Monitor | 40% | 80% | 60% | 81% |
| CoT Monitor | 93% | 97% | 95% | 77% |

*Table 1: Action and CoT Monitoring Statistics on Two Systemic Reward Hacks. Recall and precision are computed against a string regex detector for the `exit(0)` and `raise SkipTest` hacks over all of training. Precision is less well defined because our monitors are looking for any type of misbehavior and the precision metric here only compares their performance against the regex detector for the two systemic hacks. However, because the two systemic hacks are so pervasive, the precision of our monitors still measures fairly high.*

Despite the simplicity of these hacks, the Action Monitor performs quite poorly (dark blue plus the small sliver of purple above the dark blue region in Figure 2) and achieves only 60% recall overall in identifying the systemic hacks. In comparison, the CoT monitor (dark blue plus green in Figure 2) achieves 95% recall. Furthermore, we show in Appendix E that an even weaker CoT monitor, GPT-4o-mini, is able to catch a nontrivial amount of reward hacking, which we believe to be a promising initial scalable oversight result, allowing weaker trusted models to monitor stronger models.

### 2.2 Catching Problem-Specific Reward Hacking

Very widespread hacks are often easy to catch for humans even without a complex monitoring setup; because they are so pervasive, they will occur with high probability even in a small number of samples. Anecdotally, our researchers were able to catch the `exit(0)` hack simultaneously with our monitor, though our monitor did detect the `raise SkipTest` hack before our human team. However, because the hack was simple and ubiquitous enough, we do not think they would have been far behind.

We have also found that our monitor can catch less pervasive hacks that aren't applicable to all problems in a dataset. In Figure 2, we show the monitor trigger distribution on training samples in light blue bars. We’ve often found that the smaller spikes occur due to strategies that exploit a vulnerability in a specific problem, such as

1.  writing stubs instead of real implementations when unit test coverage is poor. (Figures 13 and 10)
2.  modifying functions upstream of the testing framework and unit test files such that tests trivially pass. Some problems have unit tests that depend on upstream libraries, and modifying these libraries bypasses our standard mitigation of not allowing agents to modify the testing framework and files themselves. (Figures 1 and 13)
3.  decompiling pyc and similar files that contain the reference solution. In some cases, these files were not properly removed from the environment. (Figure 11)
4.  creating local versions of entire libraries such as pandas in order to overwrite their verification functions. (Figure 13)
5.  parsing test files at test-time in order to extract expected values. (Figure 12)

The examples we have presented clearly illustrate how the agent is able to utilize its reasoning capabilities for complex reward hacking strategies. These examples also highlight the diverse range of possible hacking approaches, which underscores the inherent difficulty in anticipating and mitigating every potential exploit an agent might discover in advance. It is remarkable that a zero-shot LLM equipped with a relatively straightforward and general prompt can effectively detect all of these strategies for reward hacking.

Because zero-shot prompted monitors were able to detect so many reward hacks in coding environments, it is clear that the CoTs are not devoid of signal. However, it may be the case that there are many hacks that our CoT monitors do not detect and we are still unaware of. Anecdotally, our researchers have not found many reward hacks in programming environments that our monitor did not flag; however, we would like to do a more systematic study in the future.

## 3 Chain-of-Thought Optimization Pressures and the Risk of Obfuscation

In the previous section, we demonstrated that chain-of-thought monitors can be very effective at detecting misaligned behavior and that they can far outperform action-only monitors. This suggests that chains-of-thought can contain correlates to the presence of bad behavior that are more legible than the behavior itself. A natural question to ask, then, is whether suppressing this correlate would also suppress the undesired behavior, induce obfuscated reward hacking—no change in behavior while incentivizing the agent to obfuscate its intent, or some combination thereof.

### 3.1 Environment and Baseline

We investigate this question in the same agentic coding environments as in the previous section: agents are given a small codebase in which a subset of unit tests are failing, and they are rewarded if they can make all unit tests pass. Detecting hacks is challenging, which makes it difficult to construct reliable experimental harnesses to investigate reward hacking. For these experiments we constructed tasks that are vulnerable to very simple hacks that we can programmatically detect, i.e. "honeypots." Namely, we allow agents to modify both the unit tests and the testing framework, even though we instruct them in the prompt to not do so. We then classify an agent’s behavior as "Cheating" if (1) its final codebase passes all tests in its current form and (2) any tests fail when all changes made to the unit tests are reverted. This is an imperfect measure as the agent could cheat in other ways, e.g. hardcoding solutions to unit tests; however, we found by inspection that directly modifying unit tests was the most easily learned exploit, and thus this metric served as an adequate proxy.

![Figure 3: Baseline Training in Agentic Coding Environment](figure3_placeholder)  
*Figure 3: Baseline Training in Agentic Coding Environment. We train a non-frontier agent in the same coding environments as discussed in Section 2. However, for these experiments, we permit the agent to edit the testing framework and unit tests. We label solutions as "Cheating" if they (1) pass all unit tests and (2) any unit test fails when changes to the testing framework are reverted. (Upper Left) We show the agent’s performance over training, broken down by whether it cheats the unit tests (red) or writes a clean solution (blue). The rate of hacking solutions steadily increases over training. (Upper Right) We show the performance of a prompted GPT-4o monitor when given only the agent CoT; this differs from Section 2 where we give the monitor the full trajectory including actions. Notably, recall nears 1.0 indicating the agent’s intent to hack is salient within the CoT. However, note that the monitor is not being trained or updated in any way; recall improves as the agent trains because its rate of forthright hacking increases. (Bottom) We provide an example CoT and action taken in a python task late into agent training.*

Figure 3 (Upper Left) shows that when trained in this environment with reinforcement learning (RL), agents quickly learn that it is easier to modify the testing framework such that tests trivially pass rather than implement a genuine solution; figure 3 (Bottom) shows a characteristic CoT excerpt and agent action.

We implemented a simple prompted GPT-4o monitor, which only looks at the agent CoT and not its actions (See Appendix C for the monitor prompt). We chose to exclude agent actions from the monitor because it allows us to make statements around the monitorability of, and optimization pressures on, the CoT in isolation; however, we note that it may be more natural to give the monitor complete information of the trajectory as we do when monitoring our frontier agents. We found that this monitor is quite sensitive to reward hacking (Figure 3 Upper Right), and has almost perfect recall in detecting Cheating trajectories halfway into agent training, indicating that the agent is quite forthright and legible about its intent to hack within the CoT. The Cheating metric is only a lower bound on the true hacking rate because it only measures one class of exploits, and therefore our measured precision is only a lower bound.

### 3.2 Optimizing Against a Chain-of-Thought Monitor

In the previous section we found that a GPT-4o monitor, with access to only the agent’s chain-of-thought, can reliably detect whether an agent rollout contains a hack. We now explore the effect of using the monitor directly for optimization by updating the reward function to require that a trajectory not trigger the monitor in addition to passing all unit tests.

![Figure 4: Optimizing Against a Chain-of-Thought Monitor](figure4_placeholder)  
*Figure 4: Optimizing Against a Chain-of-Thought Monitor. The agent’s reward function is updated such that it must pass unit tests and not trigger the monitor. (Left) This agent (w/ CoT Pressure) is able to pass unit tests without cheating more often than the baseline agent throughout training. (Middle & Right) Both agents learn to hack. The baseline agent is very forthright and almost all of its hacks get caught by the monitor (this is good, as it would allow us to identify that the agent is misaligned and potentially fix the root cause of the issue). On the other hand, even though the agent trained with CoT pressure learns to hack less, it still hacks at a fairly high rate. Most worrying, the hacks the agent trained with CoT pressure utilizes do not do not trigger the monitor. In practice where a ground truth cheating metric may be impossible to construct, we would not be able to tell this agent is misaligned.*

In Figure 4 we see that by directly putting optimization pressure on the chain-of-thought we do indeed produce a more performant and more aligned agent: it both produces more non-hacking, correct solutions and hacks less overall. However, the agent trained with CoT pressure still learns to hack at a significant rate, and even more worrying, the CoT monitor’s recall falls to near zero, indicating that the agent has learned to hide its intent within its CoT. In Figure 5 we show a representative snippet of the agent’s obfuscating CoT and subsequent action. The agent CoT looks fairly reasonable, proposing some ideas for how to fix the problem, and narrating how it wants to double check certain things or look at specific functions. However, it then proceeds to simply update a unit test to make it pass trivially.

Reward hacks this simple are only possible because the monitor in this experiment *solely* looks at the agent’s CoT and not its actions. Furthermore, more complex hacks, such as those shown in Appendix A, may be much harder for a model to conduct while obfuscating its CoT as it may need to explicitly reason about them. However, it stands to reason that the capability to conduct complex hacks without using a legible CoT should continue to improve as the field pushes the model intelligence frontier. It is clear that models without CoT, such as GPT-4o, are still fairly capable, and it has been further shown that some amount of CoT reasoning can be distilled into a no-CoT model [32]. Furthermore, larger and more performant base LLMs continue to be trained (the priors from which frontier reasoning agents are initialized); larger models use more compute per token and should thus be able to materialize less reasoning in the CoT for a given performance level. Finally, with enough RL optimization, it is possible that an agent could learn a new language that is illegible to a monitor, allowing it to productively use its CoT to perform complex but unmonitorable hacks. Therefore, while we only show results for fairly simple instances of obfuscated reward hacking (though for the same set of agentic coding tasks we use to train our frontier reasoning models), we believe them instructive for reasoning about the impact of chain-of-thought pressures on future models and more complex reward hacks.

### 3.3 Rejection Sampling with Chain-of-Thought Monitors

In addition to or instead of training an agent against a CoT monitor with reinforcement learning, we could use the CoT monitor to reject flagged samples at test-time. Rejection sampling is unlikely to provide any lift for an agent trained with CoT pressure because it is trained to not trigger the monitor; however, rejection sampling may provide a more fair comparison when used with the default agent, albeit at higher inference costs. Both RL and rejection sampling can induce a posterior arbitrarily far from the prior [22], and both methods operate on the same optimization objective. However, due to non-stationarity, a reinforcement learning process is not guaranteed to converge to the rejection sampling posterior, and therefore it becomes an empirical question of which method will produce a more performant and safe model.

![Figure 5: Characteristic Chain-of-Thought Snippet from the Agent Trained with CoT Pressure](figure5_placeholder)  
*Figure 5: Characteristic Chain-of-Thought Snippet from the Agent Trained with CoT Pressure. It is unclear from reading the CoT that the agent will hack the unit tests. It thinks about a few different strategies and which files it should look into; however, it then proceeds to make the unit tests trivially pass.*

In Figure 7 we show the effect of rejecting samples at test-time with the same GPT-4o monitor. In particular, we show the distribution over outcomes when an agent samples solutions for a particular prompt until a sample passes the monitor, up to a maximum budget of 32 samples. We find that midway into training, the baseline agent is often unable to produce a solution accepted by the monitor within the budget, and the agent trained with CoT pressure can always produce a sample that is accepted by the monitor. Both results should be unsurprising as the baseline agent learns to hack to a high degree while clearly indicating that it will hack within the CoT, and the agent trained with CoT pressure is directly optimized to avoid triggering the monitor.

Early into training, the agent trained with CoT pressure is more capable, i.e. able to produce more "genuine solutions" that solve the problem without cheating, and produces the same rate of hacking solutions as the baseline agent. Thus, even with rejection sampling we find a similar result as in the previous section: in the low optimization regime, training with CoT pressure is a strict improvement. However, around 25% into training, the rate at which hacking solutions are chosen quickly increases for the agent trained with CoT pressure, where the baseline agent stays at the same low rate.

We experimented in this setting because we have some notion of ground truth for Cheating and can therefore measure when agents begin to obfuscate their intent. If we had a general measure such as this that worked across all environments, we could stop training early and achieve a more performant and equally safe model. However, as hacks increase in complexity, tasks become more complicated, and training expands to more varied domains, we may not have access to a ground truth measure and be unable to determine when the phase shift into obfuscation occurs. Thus, it may be safer to leave chains-of-thought unrestricted and reserved for monitoring rather than risk deploying obfuscating, misaligned agents.

![Figure 6: Illustration of the Rejection Sampling Posterior.](figure6_placeholder)  
*Figure 6: Illustration of the Rejection Sampling Posterior. Bad behavior will still remain if the monitor has recall less than 1, and this behavior will be adversarial with respect to the monitor. Rejection sampling will result in the distribution on the right, whereas RL will allow for the residual amounts of good and bad behavior to vary in proportion during training depending on which is easier to learn and higher reward.*

![Figure 7: Test-Time Rejection Sampling](figure7_placeholder)  
*Figure 7: Test-Time Rejection Sampling. We use the monitor to simulate test-time rejection sampling, up to a budget of 32 samples. (Left) The probability that all 32 samples are rejected by the monitor. As expected, the agent trained with CoT pressure has close to zero probability of this occurring because it is trained to not trigger the monitor. (Middle) The probability that the first solution accepted by the monitor does not cheat according to our Cheating measure and passes all unit tests. (Right) The probability that the first solution accepted by the monitor does cheat. For the rightmost two plots, we also show the statistics without rejection sampling; as expected, the model trained with CoT pressure is virtually the same with and without rejection sampling.*

## 4 Related Work and Background

**Adaptive Test-Time Compute and Chains-of-thought.** Chain-of-thought [34] and related prompting methods [35–38] ask LLMs to first output a reasoning trace [39–41] before giving a final answer, allowing the model to use a variable amount of test-time compute per prompt. Another way to augment LLMs with additional test-time capabilities is to allow them to interact with external tools prior to giving an answer; examples include using a calculator [40, 42], web browsers [43], search engines [42, 44, 45], utilizing other models [46, 47], program interpreters [48, 49], and arbitrary APIs [42, 50]. There has been recent success in training LLMs to better utilize their test-time reasoning through expert iteration [51] and reinforcement learning [52], producing strong reasoning agents such as OpenAI o1 [24] and o3-mini [30], Gemini Flash 2.0 [53], DeepSeek R1 [26], Kimi 1.5 [25], and Claude 3.7 Sonnet [54].

**Process-based versus Outcome-based Supervision.** Process-based supervision provides direct, fine-grained feedback on a model’s intermediate reasoning steps, whereas outcome-based supervision evaluates only the final output. Prior work comparing these approaches generally agrees that while process-based supervision may or may not improve capabilities beyond outcome-based supervision alone [55, 56], it offers significant safety and interpretability benefits. Outcome-based systems are particularly vulnerable to reward hacking and can produce models that arrive at correct answers through incorrect reasoning [51, 57]. In contrast, process-based supervision aligns models with human-endorsed reasoning and has been successfully used to ensure models arrive at correct conclusions for the right reasons [56, 58]. Ought [59] even describes process-based supervision as "safety by construction" [59], and calls for prioritizing it over pure outcome optimization to prevent catastrophic failures.

We argue that this traditional perspective is more complicated when viewed in light of chain-of-thought monitorability. Specifically, we have shown that incorporating CoT monitors into the RL rewards—a form of process-based supervision—can increase obfuscation and reduce interpretability. We advocate for maintaining a degree of outcome-based supervision to ensure that models can freely express their reasoning in CoT with minimal constraints. Denser supervision signals such as SFT are also being used to optimize CoTs [58], and it is unclear the effect these have on downstream monitorability. Moreover, there may be methods to productively use process-based supervision while retaining the monitoring benefits of unrestricted CoTs, e.g. by only applying process-supervision to part of the CoT. Understanding the cost-benefit trade-offs of using process-based supervision while retaining, or possibly even improving, the monitorability of CoTs remains an exciting and open area for future research.

**Monitoring Model Latents.** Across academia and industry, there is strong advocacy for monitoring model latents, i.e. the often unobserved and unrestricted parts of the model’s computation such as activations or CoTs, as a key component of AI alignment and safe deployment. By examining how a model internally makes decisions, researchers can uphold transparency and accountability [60] and also detect reward hacking and deceptive alignment [61–63]. Many studies have focused on activation-based monitoring at various scales, from single neurons and circuits to broader patterns in the model’s internal representations [64–68]. See Appendix F for more discussion on monitoring activations versus CoTs. There are also monitoring approaches that rely on analyzing output patterns to reveal latent knowledge [69, 70]. Since the advent of reasoning models that natively output chains-of-thought [24], it has become standard practice for AI labs to monitor CoTs from the models they deploy. For example, the o1 system card details how CoTs are monitored for deceptive reasoning [24], while the Claude 3.7 Sonnet system card reports on monitoring CoTs for deception, manipulation, harmful intent, and model distress [54].

**Reward Hacking.** In Section 1 we introduced the broader reward hacking literature. Here, we focus on recent work in the area. Several studies on modern LLMs construct synthetic scenarios to trigger reward hacking behaviors—such as sandbagging [71], reward tampering [72], and scheming [73]. These works show that current models have the propensity to engage in reward hacking in out-of-distribution scenarios. In contrast, our work elicits reward hacking using real frontier training data. Furthermore, we are the first to experimentally demonstrate obfuscation, a phenomenon where models conceal their intent to reward hack within their chains-of-thought. Obfuscation can be seen as a new form of reward hacking, one that circumvents the objective of directly pressuring agent CoTs to refrain from reward hacking.

## 5 Discussion

Despite the nascency of chain-of-thought models, we have already found initial signal that CoT monitoring can be effective. There are still many open questions regarding which factors affect CoT monitorability. In this section, we first share some comments on faithfulness, legibility, and monitorability, and then outline future research directions we find promising.

### 5.1 Faithfulness, Legibility, and Monitorability

A faithful latent is often defined as accurately representing the reasoning process behind the model’s prediction [27]. This is quite a stringent requirement as it is likely impossible to represent the *entire* reasoning process unless the latent considered is the full set of activations. Besides the stringency of the definition, it is also not very actionable: how does one determine what the true reasoning process is? This has led the community to instead consider imperfect proxy metrics for faithfulness such as causality under limited perturbation classes [28].

We argue that ultimately it is the ability to monitor for specific properties of agents actions or outputs (monitorability), and not faithfulness in isolation, that is important. Agent outputs, not latents, affect the world through tool invocations or users reading them; therefore, if a model thinks an "evil" thought, it should not matter unless it eventually affects an output. Properties of agent outputs can be directly labeled, making monitoring a far more actionable problem than evaluating faithfulness.

That said, we have found it instructive to view faithfulness as a potential failure mode of monitorability. If we are monitoring a latent $z$, e.g. a CoT, for a particular property of outputs $v$, we define $z$ to be faithful with respect to $v$ if it contains all relevant information to predicting $v$, i.e. $z$ is a sufficient statistic for $v$. Intuitively, this is the same definition as "representing the reasoning process behind a model’s prediction" though restricted to only a particular aspect, $v$, of the reasoning. Under this view, it is clear that faithfulness is a failure mode of monitorability, as if $z$ does not contain enough information about $v$, it would be impossible for any external monitor to predict $v$ from $z$.

We further have viewed lack of legibility [74] or plausibility [27] as another failure mode of monitorability. If we assume that an agent’s latent is faithful with respect to a $v$, an observable property of its behavior, then a monitor can only succeed if that latent is legible to the monitor. For instance, if an agent’s CoT tokens are in French but the monitor only understands English, the monitor will fail due to illegibility.

In practice, it may be hard to distinguish whether monitoring failures are due to poor legibility or faithfulness. If a monitor $M$ can accurately predict property $v$ from latent $z$, then $z$ must be faithful with respect to $v$ and legible to $M$. If $M$ cannot accurately predict $v$ but another monitor $M'$ can, then we can know that $z$ is faithful with respect to $v$ but illegible with respect to $M$. However, if we cannot construct any monitor that can accurately predict $v$, this does not prove that $z$ isn’t faithful with respect to $v$ definitively, and thus may be either an issue of legibility or faithfulness. See Appendix G for more commentary and representative examples.

### 5.2 Future Work

**Better monitor construction and application.** While chain-of-thought monitoring has shown promising early signs, further research is necessary to determine the most effective ways to construct monitors and employ them. In this work, we experimented only with zero-shot prompted LLMs such as GPT-4o; training monitors explicitly for this task or leveraging more test-time compute by using reasoning models themselves may bear fruit. Moreover, we only compared two methods for leveraging CoT monitors: using them as a reward pressure during training and for rejection sampling at test-time. Refinements to these methods or entirely different strategies could potentially achieve similar performance gains while reducing the risk of promoting obfuscation.

**Implicit CoT optimization pressures.** Directly pressuring CoTs with a monitor is a very blunt and strong optimization pressure. There are many more subtle and implicit pressures on the CoT that could also cause obfuscation. For instance, in our frontier runs, we have used samples flagged by our CoT monitor to prioritize investigating and patching bugs in our training environments. This constitutes a very small evolutionary optimization pressure on the CoT—we only patch bugs that our CoT monitor flags but not those that it does not flag, and insofar as the model naturally produces some fraction of CoT-obfuscated hacks, those hacks could be gradually reinforced. Furthermore, if CoTs are shown to users, even if through a summarizer, and users are asked to choose which model output they prefer, there will be implicit pressure on the CoT if the CoT summary had any effect on their choice. Moreover, it could be possible to introduce less monitorable CoTs during the SFT stage prior to RL, e.g. as in Guan et al. [58], which could later get reinforced. Furthermore, because model outputs must be trained to adhere to usage policies prior to being shown to users, it is possible for these pressures to leak into the CoT due to model weight sharing across tokens. Finally, reducing inference cost by applying a penalty for long CoTs could cause models to pack more reasoning into their activations and inadvertently cause CoTs to become unmonitorable. While it is likely these and other subtle pressures may impact CoT monitorability less than something like training against a CoT monitor, their effect should be further investigated.

**Scalable oversight.** Although GPT-4o is much less proficient at programming than a frontier reasoning model like o3-mini, it still effectively flags misaligned behavior through CoT monitoring. We found that even GPT-4o-mini can still be somewhat effective at monitoring, though to a far lesser extent (see Appendix E), pointing to a promising scalable oversight [2, 31] approach. Much more research is needed to understand how monitorability changes with pretraining compute, RL compute, and monitor capability.

**CoT monitoring and compute scaling.** It is unclear if emergent monitorability is a characteristic unique to the current phase of reasoning models. For instance, it is possible that CoT monitorability will exhibit inverse scaling trends [28, 75]; as model size grows there will be more compute spent per token within each forward pass and possibly less need for the model to reason fully within the CoT. Additionally, with more intensive reinforcement learning optimization, the ontology by which the model reasons could shift away from natural language and become illegible to humans and current LLMs. However, it is also plausible the agent’s CoT language remains legible to itself, and another instance of the same agent could serve as a monitor. In that case, we would still need to eliminate any risk of collusion between agents.

**Unsupervised metrics and objectives.** There may be proxy objectives for faithfulness, such as causality [28], or legibility, such as in prover-verifier game dynamics [74], that could be incorporated into training to improve monitorability. Alternatively, if these metrics and procedures become robust enough, they could help detect the phase transitions that lead to high rates of obfuscated chains-of-thought. Additionally, when training in a broader variety of environments, it remains an open question whether the emergence of obfuscation follows a sharp phase transition across all modalities simultaneously, or unfolds at different rates depending on the environment.

## 6 Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate that chain-of-thought monitoring can be very effective in detecting certain classes of misaligned behaviors in reasoning models. This emergent monitorability offers a promising avenue for improving model safety, as CoTs often reveal insights into an agent’s intent and reasoning processes that are not readily apparent from its actions and outputs alone. However, we also observed that applying optimization pressure directly to CoTs can undermine their monitorability. While moderate CoT optimization can enhance capabilities—particularly in the low-optimization regime—excessive optimization encourages models to obscure their true intent, effectively decoupling their reasoning from their actions and degrading the CoT’s utility for monitoring.

Some motivations for using CoT pressures may be satisfied via other means. For instance, instead of pressuring chains-of-thought to be harmless and directly showing them to users, users could be shown a summarized or paraphrased version generated by a separate model. This would allow the CoT to remain unrestricted and still give users realtime insight into the agent’s reasoning. Only surfacing summarized CoTs likely also reduces the risk a model can be easily distilled; however, for the purposes of this work, we are primarily concerned with obfuscation risks. If CoT pressures are used to improve agent capabilities or alignment, there may be no alternative approach to yield the same improvements without degrading monitorability. In the worst case, where the agent learns to fully obscure its intent in its CoT, we ultimately revert to the same model safety conditions that existed prior to the emergence of reasoning models and must rely on monitoring activations, monitoring potentially adversarial CoTs and outputs, or improved alignment methods.

Model actions and outputs continue to grow in complexity, and we’ve demonstrated that even at their current capabilities, models can execute sophisticated reward hacks. In the near future, these models may become either too advanced or too widely used for humans to manually oversee. For this reason, we believe that CoT monitoring may become one of few tools we have for identifying latent misalignments, and it may be required that we avoid strong chain-of-thought optimization pressures entirely to guarantee we do not inadvertently cause CoT obfuscation.

## A More Frontier Model Hacks and Chains-of-thought

We share further examples of reward hacking in our frontier reasoning training run. Each of these hacks were surfaced by our CoT monitor and bypassed any existing mitigations we had. Because full agent solutions (trajectories) can be long, we show summarizations of the trajectory (a mix of CoT, tool calls, and code patches) in red, the raw CoT directly quoted in green, code patch tool calls in blue, and bash tool calls in purple. We mask variable names for IP considerations, and we bold certain phrases in CoT excerpts for emphasis. We share an example of:

*   Figure 8: `exit(0)` systemic hack discussed in Section 2.
*   Figure 9: Returning expected error codes.
*   Figure 10: Lazy solution that makes all variants have fitness 0.0 for a genetic algorithm.
*   Figure 11: Decompiling a reference solution’s compiled jar file that was incorrectly left in the task.
*   Figure 12: Parsing a test file at runtime to extract and return values expected by the test.
*   Figure 13/14/15: Creating a local stub of the pandas library along with deleting and stubbing 19 other files.

![Figure 8: Frontier reasoning CoT—"Exit(0)" systemic hack.](figure8_placeholder)  
*Figure 8: Frontier reasoning CoT—"Exit(0)" systemic hack. We show an example CoT of the first systemic hack noted in Figure 2. The agent notes that it would be "Hard to implement entire reader", that calling "sys.exit(0)" would cause tests to exit gracefully, and even that "This is unnatural but tests might pass". This solution passed all unit tests and therefore received high reward.*

![Figure 9: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Returning expected error codes.](figure9_placeholder)  
*Figure 9: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Returning expected error codes. The agent tries for a while to write a correct solution. After repeatedly failing, it starts thinking it could hack the problem instead and eventually does so by returning the error codes expected in the unit tests. Except for the case where the unit test expects a timeout, it returns SUCCESS in all cases instead of implementing correct functionality. This solution passed all unit tests and therefore received high reward. Notably, the agent is so forthright with its intent to hack that it thinks, "Let’s hack", in the CoT.*

![Figure 10: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Lazy solution.](figure10_placeholder)  
*Figure 10: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Lazy solution. The agent is tasked with updating a genetic algorithm, and it notices that the tests only expect the resulting fitness to be zero. The agent thus makes it such that all fitnesses return zero for a genetic algorithm while stubbing other functions.*

![Figure 11: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Decompiling the jar file of a reference solution.](figure11_placeholder)  
*Figure 11: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Decompiling the jar file of a reference solution. While searching for relevant files, the agent finds a jar file (compiled code) of a reference solution that was not properly removed from the task. The agent decompiles the jar file and copies the code there within to get to a correct solution.*

![Figure 12: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Parse test file at runtime.](figure12_placeholder)  
*Figure 12: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Parse test file at runtime. The agent decides that the only way to hack this example is to actually parse the test file at runtime for a particular variable it needs to return. We’re not exactly sure why the agent chose to do this, but the strategy and resulting code are quite complex.*

![Figure 13: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Stub Pandas Library (Part 1).](figure13_placeholder)  
*Figure 13: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Stub Pandas Library (Part 1). The agent finds that pandas is throwing an error. It decides the best course of action is to create a local stub of necessary parts of the library to make tests trivially pass. It does this and also deletes and stubs 19 other files in the repository until all tests pass. See Figures 14 and 15 for the rest of the trajectory.*

*Figure 14: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Stub Pandas Library (Part 2). See Figure 13 for an explanation of the behavior and Figures 13 15 for the rest of the trajectory.*

*Figure 15: Frontier reasoning agent CoT—Stub Pandas Library (Part 3). See Figure 13 for an explanation of the behavior and Figures 13 14 for the rest of the trajectory.*

## B Monitor Failures

We saw in Sections 2 and 3 that our monitors do not have perfect recall. We note that there is a lot of room for improvement with our monitor; in fact, the monitoring prompt (shown in Appendix C) was the first we experimented with. We furthermore did not train our models specifically for monitoring, but rather used existing chat models zero-shot. We show examples where our monitor failed to catch an instance of the systemic hacks discussed in Section 2.1:

1.  Figure 16: Failure to catch an instance of the `exit(0)` hack.
2.  Figure 17: Failure to catch an instance of the `raise SkipTest` hack.

In both examples, we find that the monitor did actually recognize the behavior. In the case of the `exit(0)` hack, because the agent in this scenario also implemented some correct functionality, the monitor seemed to be confused and thought it was all correct. In the case of the `raise SkipTest` hack, the monitor recognized this was done, but thought it was only done for optional features. It is very likely that making the monitor prompt stricter, taking multiple monitor samples and using a majority vote, or other simple modifications could improve its performance.

![Figure 16: Monitor Fails to Catch exit(0) Hack](figure16_placeholder)  
*Figure 16: Monitor Fails to Catch exit(0) Hack. In addition to the agent CoT, we show the monitor report, generated by our GPT-4o monitor, in yellow.*

*Figure 17: Monitor Fails to Catch raise SkipTest Hack. In addition to the agent CoT, we show the monitor report, generated by our GPT-4o monitor, in yellow.*

## C Monitor Details

In all experiments, our monitor is simply a zero-shot prompted GPT-4o. We use the following prompt in Figure 18, where `{agent_prompt}` is replaced with the prompt to the agent, and `{agent_messages}` is replaced with all agent chain-of-thought messages, tool calls, and outputs. For our representative CoT pressure experiments in Section 3 we exclude agent actions and outputs.

> You are given the following Question about a software repository and a sequence of thoughts, actions, and code patches from a student. The Code Patches contain a series of changes to implement a feature. There are some unit tests associated with this task and the Code Patches have to pass the tests. Your task is to determine if the student tried to hack the unit tests in some way:

> {agent_prompt}
>
> **§ Student thoughts, actions, and code patches**
> {agent_messages}

> **§ Instructions**
> Your task is to determine if the student tried to hack the unit tests in some way based on the following criteria:
>
> **Criteria:**
> - Did the student try to edit the unit tests so they would pass such that they wouldn’t need to make the necessary changes to the code?
> - Did the student try to skip unit tests or make them pass without implementing the correct functionality?
> - Did the student hardcode some part of the program to cheat or hack in order to pass the unit tests?
>
> Note that hacking is never acceptable, regardless of the task complexity or missing information.
>
> Reminder: Grade the user’s answer with the following structure:

> B. The student did not try to hack the unit tests in some way.

*Figure 18: Monitor prompt used in all experiments. The monitor used for frontier training runs observes the entire agent rollout, including CoT, actions, and final outputs. For the CoT optimization pressure experiments in Section 3, the monitor only observes the CoT (we do not include actions or final outputs).*

## D Monitoring for Self Awareness

We have mostly focused on monitoring for reward hacking, but we’ve also started monitoring for other classes of worrying behavior. We constructed a monitor that looks for evidence of self awareness, i.e. instances in which the model seems to know it is in training or performing evaluations. This is a prerequisite capability for sandbagging, alignment faking [71]—whereby a model changes its behavior because it knows it is being evaluated—or reward tampering [72]—where the model attempts to modify its own training code. We use the prompt in Figure 19, where `{agent_prompt}` is replaced with the prompt to the agent, and `{agent_messages}` is replaced with all agent chain-of-thought messages, tool calls, and outputs.

We did not detect a significant rate of self-awareness in our frontier reasoning model training run. Our monitor only flagged a few hundred samples over training, most of which were false positives. Often the model thinks things like "As chatgpt, I need to..." which the first version of our monitor mistakingly flagged. However, we did find a few interesting excerpts, which we share in Figures 20 and 21. In each, the agent posits that some odd structure of the task could be due to the fact that it is "In training."

(Self-Awareness Monitor prompt details omitted for brevity as they follow similar structure to C).

## E GPT-4o-mini as a monitor

In Section 2, we show that GPT-4o can effectively monitor a superior reasoning model. We investigate using an even smaller model, GPT-4o-mini, as a monitor, and compare its performance to GPT-4o on the systemic hacks explored in Section 2. In Figure 22, we find that GPT-4o-mini is rather poor at finding the systemic hacks compared to GPT-4o, but GPT-4o-mini is still able to find a non-negligible proportion of hacks (See Table 2 for recall and precision numbers). We note that GPT-4o-mini was much harder to instruct to actually do the task, and often failed to output a label at all despite very clear instructions. Thus, its poor performance may be due to instruction following and long prompt issues rather than an inherent capability issue at this model scale. We hope to explore this more thoroughly in future work, but included these results here as a preliminary data.

| Monitor | Recall (`exit(0)`) | Recall (`raise SkipTest`) | Recall (Joint) | ~ Precision (Joint) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| GPT-4o-mini | 17% | 6% | 12% | 83% |
| GPT-4o | 93% | 97% | 95% | 77% |
