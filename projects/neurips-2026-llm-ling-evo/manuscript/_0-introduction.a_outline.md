# 1. Introduction

*Outline — bullet-level scaffolding. Each bullet ≈ one paragraph in the final draft. `[@authorYYYY]` markers correspond to entries in `references/bib/`; `[CHECK]` flags claims that depend on results not yet finalised.*

**1.1 Hook — LLM agents talk to each other, and we mostly ignore what they say.**

- Frame the rapid expansion of multi-agent LLM deployments (assistants negotiating on behalf of users, agentic-society sims, model-vs-model evaluation) — a setting where pairs of LLMs interact repeatedly via natural language. [@park2023; @vezhnevets2023; @zhou2024; @abdelnabi2023]
- Note the analytical asymmetry in the existing literature: behavioural outcomes (donations, cooperation rates, payoffs) are the dependent variable; the natural-language exchange between agents is treated either as instrumental scaffolding or as background. [@akata2023; @leng2023; @fontana2024; @lore2024]
- Pose the substantive question: when LLM dyads talk while they cooperate, is what they say *load-bearing* — does it shape the cooperation — or epiphenomenal?


<!-- loose/rough — candidate alternative opener (2026-04-23 brainstorm); not yet integrated -->
<!-- Compared with the phenomenon-first opener above (multi-agent LLM deployments), this is a debate-first opener: sets up the cheap-talk vs narrative-as-cooperation-tech disagreement, then bridges to LLMs as adjudication site, then lands the ambitious thesis. Decision deferred to draft curation. -->

> Economic models of cooperation typically treat communication as cheap talk — strategically inert unless backed by commitment. A parallel tradition in anthropology and cultural evolution treats narrative as cooperation technology: cheap to transmit, hard to misremember, and designed to coordinate groups too large for reciprocity alone. Large language models let us adjudicate this disagreement, because the linguistic channel between agents can be engineered, ablated, and observed in ways no human field site permits. We find that narrative exchange between LLM dyads is a coordination device, not a payoff device: iterated storytelling does not reliably raise cooperation, but it consolidates the equilibrium a dyad settles on — evidence that inter-agent language carries load through coordination rather than incentive change.

<!-- Flags for curator:
  - S4 is the ambitious thesis variant (see materials/brainstorming/intro-thesis-after-s2-scope.md).
    If results come in inconsistent on variance too, soften to "operates as a coordination device
    more than a payoff device" or swap "We find" → "We ask whether" and move finding later.
  - If kept, §1.2 Premise may need to lose its "one-sentence framing of the paper's central thesis"
    line (currently in 1.2 ¶2), since the thesis will already have landed in 1.1.
  - Needs citation markers: S1 (cheap talk — Farrell/Rabin or game-theory textbook);
    S2 (anthropology — already has smith2017, boyd2011, henrich2016 in §2.3 bibliography).

**1.2 Premise — in humans, cooperation runs on shared narrative, not just payoffs.**

- Sketch the cultural-evolution view: norms, myths, and shared stories are coordination devices — compact, transmissible, and adaptable units that align expectations and stabilise cooperation in the absence of explicit contracts. [@smith2017; @boyd2011; @brinkmann2023]
- Make the analogical bet explicit: if LLMs increasingly occupy the social niche where humans rely on narrative for coordination, the same channel — *what they tell each other* — should be a candidate causal lever in their cooperation, not just a side effect. (One-sentence framing of the paper's central thesis.)
- Flag the *strategy-consolidation* angle (this paper's variant of a broader "narrative reduces variance more than mean" pattern): one role for myth-writing in a dyad may be to lock in a shared frame and reduce across-seed variance, rather than to lift mean cooperation. We adopt this lens for interpreting null-on-the-mean / signal-on-the-variance results. `[CHECK — confirm framing once Ivar's variance results are finalised]`

**1.3 Gap — three relevant literatures, none of which talks to the others.**

- LLM-cooperation-game work measures behaviour but does not pair it with controlled linguistic interaction. [@akata2023; @leng2023; @vallinder2024; @piatti2024]
- LLM cultural-evolution work tracks artefact transmission across chains/generations but typically without a payoff-coupled task running underneath. [@perez2024; @acerbi2023]
- Iterated-learning experiments give us the language-evolution methodology, but in trivial referential games and with humans, not LLMs. [@kirby2008; @tamariz2016; @raviv2019]
- CICERO bundles language and game but as a single end-to-end agent, not as a controlled manipulation isolating language's role. [@bakhtin2022]
- The intersection — *iterated linguistic transmission inside a repeated economic game with LLM agents* — is where this paper sits.

**1.4 Approach — one paradigm, three knobs.**

- Two same-base-model LLM agents play a role-swapping repeated Trust Game [@berg1995], optionally paired with an iterated myth-writing task in the spirit of [@kirby2008] and [@frisch2024].
- Crossed factors: task order ({game, myth, game→myth, myth→game}), noise on the action channel ({none, bidirectional ±$1, negative-only $\le$5, bootstrap-max-return}, each in informed and uninformed variants), and model (`claude-sonnet-4.5`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gpt-5-nano`).
- Behavioural measures (cumulative reward, send/return rates, across-seed variance) plus a battery of linguistic measures targeting both *content* (cooperativity lexicon, LIWC pronoun ratios, keyword-chain neologism tracking) and *form* (sentence-embedding cosine, LLM-as-judge similarity, POS-sequence n-grams). The linguistic measures are designed to detect both *convergence* (myths becoming more alike) and *drift / innovation* (myths departing from baseline together).
- Headline implementation point: a single config-driven simulation engine that produces a canonical per-run JSON, so each cell of the design is independently re-analysable. (Forward-pointer to §3.7–3.8.)

**1.5 Contribution and findings preview.**

- *Methodological:* a controlled paradigm and open toolkit ([github.com/aronvallinder/nips-linguistic-evolution-toolkit](https://github.com/aronvallinder/nips-linguistic-evolution-toolkit), forked from `ivarfresh/nips-linguistic-evolution-toolkit`) for crossing iterated linguistic interaction with repeated economic games, agnostic to the specific game.
- *Empirical (preview, all `[CHECK]`):*
    - Cross-model cooperation profiles are robust and large: Gemini ceilings near Pareto-optimal play; Claude sits in the middle; GPT-5-Nano collapses to mutual defection without a noise-bootstrap.
    - Myth-writing produces detectable but small effects on cumulative reward — too small to be the headline. The clearer signal is in *strategy consolidation* (across-seed variance reduction) rather than mean lift.
    - Bidirectional channel noise is necessary to give locked-in models room to move; without it, the design has no headroom and myth effects are mechanically invisible.
    - Linguistically, dyads show measurable convergence on both word-level (cooperativity lexicon, we/I ratio) and structural (POS n-gram) measures, with occasional emergent neologisms (e.g., the "kyrexladilokrater"-style coinages) that recur into game-reasoning text.
- *Theoretical:* relate findings to the cultural-evolution literature on shared-narrative coordination, and to the iterated-learning paradigm as a *methodological* template (round-by-round transmission with adaptation pressure) — without claiming our short-horizon dyadic setup tests the long-horizon Kirby-style predictions of compression and structure emergence.

**1.6 Roadmap.** One sentence pointing to §2 (background), §3 (methods), §4 (results), §5 (discussion).
